# Machine Learning

1. **What**: Extract/Learn useful patterns from data
2. **How**: Algorithm/Architecture/Model
    - Defines a function (has parameters): Hypothesis Step
    - Defines a loss/error/objective function (depends on actual and predicted labels in case of supervised learning)
        - Eucledian Distance (Square)
        - Cross Entropy
        - Hinge Loss
        - Information Gain
        - Gini Index
        - Likelihood
    - Does optimization on loss wrt the parameters (to estimate parameters and ultimately the function)
        - First order methods
            - Batch Gradient Descent: Whole sample is used per iteration (simple, global optimum for convex functiuons, complexity is O(N*D) for each iteration/epoch which is large for big-data, no online update)
            - Stochastic Gradient Descent (one random sample is used per iteration/epoch, complexity is O(D) for each iteration and hence increases the overall
optimization efficiency at the expense of more iterations, gradient direction oscillates because of additional noise introduced by random selection and thus more variance of gradient is large, learning process is sometimes prolonged, fluctuation helps the objective function jump to another possible minimum, how to avoid saddle point?)
            - Mini-batch Gradient Descent (b independent identically distributed samples (b is generally in 50 to 256), reduces the variance of the gradients and makes the convergence more stable)
        - Higher order methods
        - 
4. **How (Practical)**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

**Note**: Learning as Parameter Estimation or Learning as Optimization

## Types of ML
1. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc
    - Classification
    - Regression
    - Seq-Seq Learning

2. Semi-supervised Learning
3. Unsupervised Learning: K-Means, Dimensionality Reduction
