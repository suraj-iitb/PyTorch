# Machine Learning

1. **What**: Extract/Learn useful patterns from data
2. **How**: Algorithm/Architecture/Model (defines a function and does optimization and estimate parameters)
3. **How (Practical)**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

## Types of ML
1. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc
    - Classification
    - Regression
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Unsupervised Learning: K-Means, Dimensionality Reduction
5. Reinforcement Learning
6. Seq-Seq Learning
